Design/methodology/approach This study constructed the severity assessment system of public events from the dimensions of the netizens‚Äô role, the Internet media‚Äôs role, the spread of public events and the attitudes and feelings of netizens. The method of analyzing the influence tendency of the public event severity indicators was proposed. A total of 1,107,308 microblogging entries regarding four public events were investigated. The severity of public events was divided into four levels. Findings It is found that serious public events have higher indicator values than medium level events on the microblogging platform. A quantitative severity classification standard for public events was established and the early warning mechanism of public events was built. Research limitations/implications Microblogging and other social media platforms provide rich clues for the real-time study and judgment of public events. This study only investigated the Weibo platform as the data source. Other social media platforms can also be considered in future. Originality/value Different from the ex-post evaluation method of judging the severity of public events based on their physical loss, this study constructed a quantitative method to dynamically determine the severity of public events according to the clues reflected by social media. The results can help the emergency management departments judge the severity of public events objectively and reduce the subjective negligence and misjudgment.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">INR</abbr></div> <div id="WOS:000751595100006" class="col-sm-8"> <h5 class="title">Archetypes of influential users in social question-answering sites</h5> <div class="author"> <em style="font-weight: bold; color: var(--global-theme-color);">Miaomiao Chen*</em>,¬†Alton Chua,¬†and¬†Lu An</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Internet Research</em> 2025 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge grey waves-effect font-weight-light mr-1 collapsed" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://www.emerald.com/intr/article-abstract/35/1/419/1241690/Archetypes-of-influential-users-in-social-question?redirectedFrom=fulltext" class="badge grey waves-effect font-weight-light mr-1 collapsed" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Purpose This paper seeks to address the following two research questions. RQ1: What are the influential user archetypes in the social question-answering (SQA) community? RQ2: To what extent does user feedback affect influential users in changing from one archetype to another? Design/methodology/approach Based on a sample of 13,840 influential users drawn from the Covid-19 community on Zhihu, the archetypes of influential users were derived from their ongoing participation behavior in the community using the Gaussian mixture model. Additionally, user feedback characteristics such as relevance and volume from 222,965 commenters who contributed 546,344 comments were analyzed using the multinomial logistic regression model to investigate the archetype change of influential users. Findings Findings suggest that influential users could be clustered into three distinctive archetypes: touch-and-go influential users, proactive influential users and super influential users. Moreover, feedback variables have various impacts on the influential user archetype change, including a shift toward creating higher-quality content and fostering increased interaction, a shift toward generating lower-quality content and decreased interaction but improved speed and having mixed effects due to differences in information processing among these archetypes. Originality/value This study expands the existing knowledge of influential users and proposes practical approaches to cultivate them further.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">IPM</abbr></div> <div id="WOS:000681134700007" class="col-sm-8"> <h5 class="title">Combining deep neural network and bibliometric indicator for emerging research topic prediction</h5> <div class="author"> Zhentao Liang,¬†Jin Mao*,¬†Kun Lu,¬†Zhichao Ba,¬†and¬†Gang Li</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Information Processing &amp; Management</em> 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge grey waves-effect font-weight-light mr-1 collapsed" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457321001072" class="badge grey waves-effect font-weight-light mr-1 collapsed" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Predicting emerging research topics is important to researchers and policymakers. In this study, we propose a two-step solution to the problem of emerging topic prediction. The first step forecasts the future popularity score, a novel indicator reflecting the impact and growth, of candidate topics in a time-series manner. The second step selects novel topics from the candidates predicted to be popular in the first step. Terms with domain characteristics are used as candidate topics. Deep neural networks, specifically LSTM and NNAR, are applied with nine features of topics to predict popularity score. We evaluated the models and five baselines on two datasets from two perspectives, i.e., the ability to (1) predict the correct indicator value and (2) reconstruct the optimal ranking order. Two types of training strategies were compared, including a global strategy that trains a model with all topics and two local strategies that train separate models with different groups of topics. Our results show that LSTM and NNAR outperform other models in predicting the value of popularity score measured by MAE and RMSE, while LightGBM is a competitive baseline in ranking the topics in terms of NDCG@20. The performance difference of global and local strategies is not significant. Emerging topics predicted by our approach are compared with those by other methods. A qualitative assessment on nominated emerging topics suggests topics nominated by machine learning methods are more alike than those by the rulebased model. Some important topics are nominated according to a preliminary literature analysis. This study exploited the strengths of both machine learning and bibliometric indicator approaches for emerging topic prediction. Deep neural networks are applied where objective optimization target can be defined and measured. Bibliometric indicator offers an efficient way to select novel topics from candidates. The hybrid approach shows promise in considering various characteristics of emerging topics when making predictions.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">SCIM</abbr></div> <div id="WOS:000710334600005" class="col-sm-8"> <h5 class="title">Finding citations for PubMed: a large-scale comparison between five freely available bibliographic data sources</h5> <div class="author"> Zhentao Liang,¬†Jin Mao*,¬†Kun Lu,¬†and¬†Gang Li</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Scientometrics</em> 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge grey waves-effect font-weight-light mr-1 collapsed" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04191-8" class="badge grey waves-effect font-weight-light mr-1 collapsed" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script><div data-altmetric-id="115726198" class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="0" data-badge-popover="right" data-badge-type="2" style="display:inline"></div> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>As an important biomedical database, PubMed provides users with free access to abstracts of its documents. However, citations between these documents need to be collected from external data sources. Although previous studies have investigated the coverage of various data sources, the quality of citations is underexplored. In response, this study compares the coverage and citation quality of five freely available data sources on 30 million PubMed documents, including OpenCitations Index of CrossRef open DOI-to-DOI citations (COCI), Dimensions, Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), National Institutes of Health‚Äôs Open Citation Collection (NIH-OCC), and Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC). Three gold standards and five metrics are introduced to evaluate the correctness and completeness of citations. Our results indicate that Dimensions is the most comprehensive data source that provides references for 62.4% of PubMed documents, outperforming the official NIH-OCC dataset (56.7%). Over 90% of citation links in other data sources can also be found in Dimensions. The coverage of MAG, COCI, and S2ORC is 59.6%, 34.7%, and 23.5%, respectively. Regarding the citation quality, Dimensions and NIH-OCC achieve the best overall results. Almost all data sources have a precision higher than 90%, but their recall is much lower. All databases have better performances on recent publications than earlier ones. Meanwhile, the gaps between different data sources have diminished for the documents published in recent years. This study provides evidence for researchers to choose suitable PubMed citation sources, which is also helpful for evaluating the citation quality of free bibliographic databases.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">JOI</abbr></div> <div id="WOS:000602873300007" class="col-sm-8"> <h5 class="title">Quantifying cross-disciplinary knowledge flow from the perspective of content: Introducing an approach based on knowledge memes</h5> <div class="author"> Jin Mao,¬†Zhentao Liang*,¬†Yujie Cao,¬†and¬†Gang Li</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Informetrics</em> 2020 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract badge grey waves-effect font-weight-light mr-1 collapsed" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157720301516" class="badge grey waves-effect font-weight-light mr-1 collapsed" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Knowledge flow between disciplines is typically measured through citations among publications. In this study, we quantify cross-disciplinary knowledge diffusion from the novel perspective of content by introducing knowledge memes, a special type of knowledge unit. Diffusion cascade is proposed to model the diffusion process of knowledge memes. By taking Medical Informatics (MI) as an exemplary interdisciplinary discipline, we measure the knowledge relationships between it and four related disciplines. The diffusion patterns of cross-disciplinary memes are also identified by analyzing the network structure of the diffusion cascade. The results present the knowledge relationships among disciplines measured by knowledge memes, which are different from those measured by citations. It is shown that preferential attachment takes effect in cross-disciplinary knowledge meme diffusion. In addition, cross-disciplinary knowledge memes generally originate earlier and have higher impact than the memes of MI. This study provides insights into new approaches to quantifying knowledge relationships among disciplines and furthers the understanding of content diffusion mechanisms through measurable knowledge units.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%63%68%65%6E%6D%69%61%6F%6D%69%61%6F%32%30%32%30@%66%6F%78%6D%61%69%6C.%63%6F%6D" title="email"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8384-6452" title="ORCID" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-orcid"></i></a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jYBylScAAAAJ&amp;hl" title="Google Scholar" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note"></div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> ¬© Copyright 2025 Miaomiao Chen.
